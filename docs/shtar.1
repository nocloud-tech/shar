.SH "NAME"
shtar \- an archive utility similar to `tar`
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBshtar\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Print a short help message.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i, \-\-input\fP \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Use \fIFILE\fP as the input. Note that \fIFILE\fP can be a regular file, but it can
also be a directory (e.g., for recursion). If \fIFILE\fP is not specified,
standard input is used and the resulting archive is not recursive \- that is,
it only contains a single file, not a directory with nested files and directories.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o, \-\-output\fP \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Use \fIFILE\fP as the output file name. If no output file is specified,
standard ouput is used.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s, \-\-shebang\fP
.RS 4
Include a "shebang" at the beginning of the output. Note that if this option
is specified, the resulting output will include a \fI#!/bin/sh\fP (or similar)
line. See the \fI\-\-sh\-path\fP option.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S, \-\-no\-shebang\fP
.RS 4
Do the \fIopposite\fP of the \fI\-\-shebang\fP option.  That is, don\(cqt include the
\fI#!/bin/sh\fP line.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p, \-\-sh\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP
.RS 4
Indicate the path to the shell script interpreter. By default this is
\fI!/bin/sh\fP, although paths to other shells (like \fI!/bin/dash\fP and
\fI#!/usr/local/bin/zsh\fP) should also fine too.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d, \-\-destination\fP \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Use \fIFILE\fP as the output path when extracting the archive. Note that this is
not the same as the \fI\-\-output\fP option. That is, the \fI\-\-output\fP option will
create a filesystem name \fIfor the archive itself\fP whereas the \fI\-\-destination\fP
option will create a filesystem name \fIfor the extracted file or directory\fP.
Note that for directories, the \fI\-\-destination\fP option is only used for the
top\-level directory.
.RE
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
\f(CRshtar\fP will exit with \f(CR0\fP on success and non \f(CR0\fP on failure. An error message
should appear indicating the cause of this error.
.SH "RESOURCES"
