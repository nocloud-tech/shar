The following is a list of items that should be completed.

*Add execute permissions if the archive is not written to standard output.*

*Ensure created files have the same r/w/x permissions as the original.*

*Ensure created directories have the same r/w/x permissions as the original.*

*Stop using `DIR*` for type detection (the `d_type` value).*

*Finish the `-h` command.*

*Make the private functions static.*

*Installation scripts on various platforms.*

E.g., snap initially, then others.
